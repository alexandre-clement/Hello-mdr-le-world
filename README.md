# Projet-Brainfuck

## idées pour la démonstration 1
- choose example tests as less as possible, to show the function works.
    - maybe talk about variables tests to make sure not erreurs. (show some)
    - lack of Linux shell
- talk about the blingblings, explain why. 
    - s6  add the first stdoutOption into the list, ignore the others. -p --rewrite not execute at the same time
- talk about the member's work 
    - level 1: discussed together (interface make sure), work separately by parts of package/structure . 
    - level 2: work on different slices
